# Video-chat-app

Created a peer-to-peer video chat web application using WebRTC for connection and Socket.io for signaling.
To start the chat, the user must enter their email address and share the room code with the other participant.
The participant can join the chat room by providing their email address and the room code.
Used ReactJs for the client side and NodeJs for the server to establish a connection between the peers.
